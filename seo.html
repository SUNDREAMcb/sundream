                        <h1>SEO Audit</h1>
                         
                        <p>I’m well versed in SEO Account management. 
                            SEO is ever-changing, as is the landscape we expect to show up in. 
                            When we type in a key phrase, such as “Digital Marketing Agencies”, 
                            a keyword is sent through the search engine to try to match that word to a result that is the most relevant, 
                            original and is well-written. </p>
                            <h2>SEO Fundamentals</h2> 
                            <p>We can ‘talk’ to the engine by giving it signals. Title Tags and Headers
                            are the main elements to optimize for in this regard, so putting our keyphrase in here will have the most weight.
                            Other elements include image alt text, meta data, and page readability. These fall under the On-Page SEO topic,
                            which implies the existence of Off-Page SEO, achieved through growing brand awareness and recognition. 
                            Authority in this sense means other trustworthy websites trust you and link back to you.  </p>
                         
                    </div>
                   
                     <div style="width: 100% ;border-radius: 0; ">  
                        
                        <h1>Technical SEO </h1>
                         
                        <p>A fast-loading site reduces bounce rates and keeps users engaged, which positively impacts rankings.
                             I address issues such as slow-loading resources, optimize images, improve server response times, and implement responsive design. 
                            </p>
                        
                        
                        <h2>What is Technical SEO? </h2>
                        <p>Technical SEO is about getting your website to perform well in terms of visibility. 
                        A search engine needs to first find your website, then ‘crawl’ over every page it can find, and finally index it. 
                        Indexing will be where google understands the content of your site and pages takes place. In order to appear in the search engine results page, 
                        we need to be indexed. Other key factors of technical SEO include managing site-speed, mobile device optimization and refactoring site structure if absolutely necessary. 
                        Submitting an XML Sitemap to a search engine basically says “these are the pages you need to look for”, 
                        while a Robots.txt file is the opposite: “Disregard these urls, no need to index these.” such as a ppc-campaign landing page, or a thank you page. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: 100% ;border-radius: 0; ">  
                        
                        <h1>Local SEO</h1>
                         
                        <p>Local SEO is a process of optimizing a business for a particular geographical region. 
                            Local SEO can be by county, city, or even state, but the purpose is to drive near-by users to a business. 
                        </p>
                        <h2>Optimize Google Business Profile</h2>
                        <p> Google will review relevance to a keyphrase, distance from user and how well-known a business is to factor in how they rank on Google Maps. 
                            There are many areas of opportunity to optimize here, so having up-to-date information is key! Researching competition can be a worthwhile tactic, 
                            especially when there is means to capitalize where competition lacks. 
                            For Local SEO, I use SEMRush, Google Business Profiles and Google Search Console. </p>
                            </p>
                       
                    </div>
                    <div style="width: auto ;border-top-right-radius: 0;border-top-left-radius: 0;">  
                        
                        <h1>Content Development</h1>
                        <p>The most important thing you can provide to both your users and the search engine is: context.
                            The more information you can give regarding the service, product or topic your page is about, the better. 
                            This is because not only are you increasing the frequency of the targeted keyword and related keyphrases,
                            but are also giving more keyword targeting opportunities, such as FAQs or related fields.</p>
                            <h2>Content Expansion</h2>
                        <p>Breaking the content into bite-size, organic chunks or high quality pieces of information provides the context of what the page is about while providing your voice to the user.
                            There is always an opportunity for content expansion! Consider writing about common applications or users, which gives you more opportunity to tie the content around the targeted keyword.
                            Common tools include utilizing ChatGPT to get an overview of the topic, workshop some talking points, Google Search results and a character or word counter.
                            I also enjoy researching the topic myself with primary sources if available, such as marketing resources from the business or a conversation with an engineer. </p>
