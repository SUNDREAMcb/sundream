I built this website fresh off the heels of my 24 hour website build, not only to sharpen and retain my HTML / CSS knowledge, 
but to compile my work into a more representative product. This website has much more going for me, and will be great to fill out as the months go by.<p>

“Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence.” – Vince Lombardi</h3>
<p>In my free time, you can find me journaling, editing videos, playing music or in a round of Fortnite. Lately, I've been compiling projects, taking on new skills such as Python, Github and JS. Eventually the plan is to have a contact form from this website tied to my email, so I'll likely need to learn PHP soon. Will update when that comes to light!  <p>

                    <p style="color: aliceblue; padding: 1vw; text-shadow: 0.07em 0.07em 0.05em black;"> 
                        I think these projects not only represent me well as a creative person,
                         but someone who has the follow through to accomplish any task I want. 
                         Working on a team makes me happy to be part of something greater than myself.

                                <p class="card-desc">By following an ad on Craigslist in ~2018, we put together a band that took covers of the Strokes very seriously. We played with the same equipment , sound and tenacity as the real deal, especially since they were not exactly a touring band at the time. We played venues like Antone's, Stubb's, Empire Garage and even got asked specifically to open for the Red Not Chili Peppers; one of the most well recognized Cover bands.  </p>

Since I could remember, i've loved the boxy-style look of the Volvo but could never afford the most expensive part of having the car: Time. Since moving to Bee Cave and working close to my job, I can afford both now and restoring it to some kind of glory is a worthy and rewarding challenge.</p>

                                    I used ChatGPT to create the initial game loop, turning words into letters into underscores & 
                                    expanded that to be a more personalized, playable game. Added a difficulty selection screen which chooses harder words & gives you less chances to be wrong. Finally added a 'help' screen or 'quit' option for the terminal game to end when you like.  </p>

                                     I bought all the parts and asked for his tools and guidance. We spent about 7 weekends measuring, cutting, polishing, 
                                     tuning and making a product that was worth walking home with. Inspired by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard's Flying Banana and Yamaha's Samurai.  https://imgur.com/a/mdfTn https://imgur.com/a/b668B https://imgur.com/a/oWNhl </p>
